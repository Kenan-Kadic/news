            <v-layout>One of the benefits of Nuxt, once you set aside server side rendering with the initial prerender, is that you no longer have to worry about manually providing your own Routing. You can create .vue files in your pages folder and the structure of pages and files will automatically generate routing for you with the vue-router configuration. Alternatively you can also, from what Kenan learned, create folders inside the pages folder and place inside them index.vue files. The effect will essentially look the same. It is worth noting that while Nuxt provides many features, it is not very heavy. That is another one of its benefits. It will allow you to create universal web apps--basically meaning javascript code that can execute both on the server side and the client side.</v-layout>
